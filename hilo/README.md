# Hilo game
Hilo is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher or lower than the previous one. Points are won or lost based on whether or not the player guessed correctly.

You will start with 300 points, there are also 13 cards (1 to 13). After a card is displayed, you must guess if the next one will be of a higher or a lower value than current card. If you win, then you will earn 100 points, otherwise you will lose 75.

Game ends when you desire or when you reach 0 points in your bag.
